The way this calculator works is:

1- It takes two operands and an operator.
2- If you press the equals key, the result will be the Left Operand for future operations.
3- If you add a third operator (
        For example: 2+2+7
 The calculator will solve 2+2 first and add 7 to the result
)
4- You can add as many operations as you want and get a result.
5- Floating point numbers will be rounded to the nearest integer.
